## Getting Started

The **number_paginator** widget allows you to implement pagination with page numbers very easily. If you have a list that is split up into several pages, **number_paginator** can be used to let the user switch between these page numbers.
The package automatically handles the case where page numbers don't fit on one screen and replaces some of them with three dots.
